    - 04:00pm : before timer interrupt 
    
      Sketch uses 15624 bytes (48%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes.
      Global variables use 1681 bytes (82%) of dynamic memory, leaving 367 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.
      Low memory available, stability problems may occur.

    - 04.35pm : after replacing univrsal timer with timer interrupt
      Sketch uses 15076 bytes (46%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes.
      Global variables use 1611 bytes (78%) of dynamic memory, leaving 437 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.
      Low memory available, stability problems may occur.

    - 10:05pm : after changing to Timer 1
      Sketch uses 15392 bytes (47%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes.
      Global variables use 1694 bytes (82%) of dynamic memory, leaving 354 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.
